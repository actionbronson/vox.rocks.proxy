# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This is a proxy server meant to access the VOX.rocks music service which itself provides no REST api.  The functionality was entirely reversed-engineer with mitmproxy. 

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 

This proxy uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5.2+
* A facebook login with VOX, as this is the only oauth method I support!

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python -m swagger_server --email $FACEBOOK_EMAIL --password $FACEBOOK_PASS --method facebook --library-build
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
